JavaScript was used to solve the b2w challenge because it is the programming language that I am most interested in at this moment.  
I have started learning it due their advantages like being an open source project and mainly the fact it can be used in web applications both on the client side and on the server side.  

HellsTriangle challenge - How to run:
1 - Download the files and put it into any path in your computer
2 - Open any browser (for example: Google Chrome) and check if JavaScript is not disabled
3 - Go to the directory which are the files and specify to open the file index.html
4 - Click on the button you want to test

Resize challenge - How to run:
1 - Install node, npm and their necessary packages (node-rest-client, image-downloader, resize-img and so on)
2 - Install mongodb
3 - Run MongoDB server using "mongod.exe" (You can also run MongoDB client using "mongo.exe" to see the changes on database). 
4 - Run "getImages.js" to download, resize and store the images on the server side
5 - Run "createCollection.js" to create a collection in database
6 - Run "storeData.js" to store image information in database
7 - Run "endPoint.js" to create a server and wait for a request
8 - Finally, open your browser and test the aplication. If you insert a path like "http://localhost:8080/Images/b737_1large.jpg" it will appear this respective airplane image. Otherwise, it will be shown a list of images, thier formats and urls (JSON format).
